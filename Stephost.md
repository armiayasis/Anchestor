## 📁 Required Configuration Files

### 🖥️ VPS Deployment

If you're deploying your bot on a **VPS** (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS), ensure the following files are in your project root:


📄 config.json
📄 configCommands.json
📄 account.txt


☁️ Hosting on Platforms like Render

When deploying to cloud platforms such as Render, Heroku, or Railway, use the following configuration files:

📄 config.dev.json
📄 configCommands.dev.json
📄 account.dev.txt


🔁 config.dev.json is optimized for development/CI environments with environment variables and limited file access. and you need dual file for config because of fca miss coding first you have to create config.json and again config.dev.json for render to understand
